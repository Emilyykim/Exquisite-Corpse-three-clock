## Briefs for each stage

### ðŸ”´ Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### ðŸŸ¡ Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### ðŸŸ¢ Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### ðŸ”µ Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### ðŸŸ£ Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

 # Chromatic Clock

This project is a unique representation of time using a color-changing background. The clock runs on a 10-second cycle, where the hue of the background changes from 0 to 360 degrees on the HSB colour scale. This visual change gives an unconventional yet constant sense of time passing.

## Instructions

- Clone the repository.
- Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the clock.

## Concept

Time is often perceived through changes in our environment. This clock visualizes time through continuous and smooth colour transitions, creating a new way to experience the passage of seconds.

# Celestial Clock

This project presents an unconventional representation of time using a dynamic display of celestial images and star patterns. The "Celestial Clock" uses a continuous cycle to display images of nebulae, black holes, and supernovas, interspersed with randomly appearing stars, to create a constantly changing visual experience.

## Instructions

- Clone the repository.
- Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the clock.

## Concept

The passage of time is represented through the changing and moving images of celestial objects, reflecting the ongoing cycles and transformations in the universe. Adding a starry background that evolves emphasizes the dynamic nature of space.

## Changes from Inherited Work

- Maintained the sequential display of celestial images.
- Added animated horizontal movement for images.
- Introduced a trailing effect for a more dynamic background.
- Modified star drawing to occur consistently, enhancing the visual experience.
- Enhanced image display logic to include motion and direction changes.

# Dynamic Ice Cream Stacker

This project presents a playful and interactive game where users can stack scoops of ice cream. The "Dynamic Ice Cream Stacker" allows you to add vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry scoops, with each scoop pulsating to create a dynamic visual effect. The game alerts you when the stack gets too high with a colorful screen effect and encourages you to start over.

## Instructions

- Clone the repository.
- Open `index.html` in a web browser to play the game.

## Concept

The game represents the fun and creativity involved in stacking scoops of ice cream. The pulsing effect adds a dynamic and lively feel to the scoops, making the stacking process visually engaging. The game-over effect and interactive reset button provide a complete and enjoyable user experience.

## Changes from Inherited Work

- Maintained the button functionality for adding scoops and resetting the ice cream.
- Introduced a pulsing effect for scoops to create dynamic visuals.
- Added an array to manage and draw multiple scoops.
- Enhanced the background and scoop redrawing process for better visual engagement.
- Improved interactive elements to make the game more responsive and enjoyable.

 Stage 3 Dataset Visualization :

Iâ€™ll integrate a dataset that relates to astronomical events. For this example, letâ€™s use a dataset containing information about astronomical events (black hole sightings, supernova events, etc.). Weâ€™ll visualize this data by displaying the frequency of these events as a bar chart alongside the moving images.

Stage 3 Explanation:

	â€¢	Dataset: Integrated a simple dataset (events) representing frequencies of astronomical events.
	â€¢	Bar Chart Visualization: Added a drawBarChart function to visualize the dataset as a bar chart at the bottom of the canvas.
